	\section*{\textbf{1. About TeXchat}}
	\vspace{4mm}
			\\TeXchat is an open source messaging application that is developed for the Android platform and works in a similar fashion to normal SMS services.  It works through a Jabber server which connects users and allows communication.  It was originally developed to support users that need to collaborate and communicate in a mathematical or scientific environment, therefore allowing them to effectively construct and send mathematical expressions in line with plain text messages. It is supported by most android platforms from version 2.2 through 4.3.\\
		\vspace{5mm}
		
\section*{\textbf{2. TeXchat vs. SMS}}
	\vspace{4mm}
		 \\TeXchat works in a similar fashion to normal SMS services. SMS is an older and limited messaging system that has limited capabilities, specifically it supports mostly plain text messages and at a relatively high cost. \\ 
		 
		 The TeXchat application allows this basic plain text messaging functionality, and includes the ability for users to construct, edit and view mathematical expressions and then add them as images inline to the rest of the plain text message body.  This feature makes TeXchat unique and supports anyone in an educational, mathematical or scientific environment who may have a need to communicate effectively using such mathematical expressions. \\  
		 
		 The TeXchat messaging service is freely available online, and uses an open and free Jabber server.  Therefore using the TeXchat service has no additional cost to the user except the bandwidth used to exchange data, which is another advantage of making use of this messenger service as opposed to using the older and conventional SMS service.   \\

	\section*{3. User Guide: Getting Started}
	\vspace{4mm}
	\\Once you have the application correctly installed and configured to an available online Jabber server, you can click on the TeXchat icon and this will open the application Login Page.  
	
	\\This is the TeXchat icon that will be displayed on your device menu, once you have the application installed.
	
	\\For more information on how to configure your device with an available online Jabber server see the Configuration section below.
	
	\vspace{5mm}

\newpage
	\section*{4. Configuration}
	\\To access the Configuration/Settings page, open the application, after you have installed it on your device,press the back button on your device. This will take you to a blank page. Press the menu button, then click on Settings. This will open the settings page where you can configure your details. \\
	\\\textbf{Host name} will contain the name of your jabber host, for example, jabber.iitsp.com. 
	\\\textbf{Server name} will have the name of your jabber host, for example, jabber-0-1.virt.iitsp.com\\
	 Click on Host name and Server name to change the current settings.

		\section*{5. User Login}
		\vspace{4mm}
		\\The login page is displayed once the application is opened.  
		
		\\A user that is already registered to use the TeXchat service may simply enter his/her selected username and password in the corresponding fields on the login page, then click on the Login button displayed below.  You should then see the login dialog appear, that is displayed while the application attempts to log in to the Jabber server.  Once this operation is completed, you will see your contact list displayed.\\ 
		
		If you are a first time user, you will be greeted with a message after successfully logging in: \textit{"You currently do not have any contacts.  Select the menu option to add a contact."} \\
		\\For information on how to add a contact, see the Adding a Contact sub section below.\\
		
		\\If you already have contacts added to your account, you will see a contact list displayed, which will also provide information regarding the availability of any particular contact.  If a contact is currently offline, the text offline is displayed below the contact’s name, and similarly for contacts that are currently available.\\

		\\If you open the application, and see the login page appear after successfully signing in, you will see the Remember Me option presented to you on the login page.  When you select the check box, the application will save your login details, and automatically log you in to your account. \\ 
		
		\\This automatic sign in feature is provided for cases in which the application is abruptly closed, or the application crashed for any reason or simply for user convenience.  The Remember Me information is securely stored locally on your android device and will remain up until you explicitly select the Logout option from your device’s menu. Only once you have explicitly logged out, will the remember me feature be disabled.  \\

		\section*{9. User Registration}
		\vspace{5mm}
		\\If you are a first time user, and would like to use the TeXchat messenger application, you will have to register as a user on the server first.  To do this, you can install the application, and click on the icon to start the application.  The first page you will see once the application is running is the login page.  On the login page, you will see the Register button, which you can click on, and this will open the registration form.

		\\The registration form has various required fields for you to fill in, including your TeXchat username, your display name and password.  Once you have completed the form, you can click on the Register button.  If the message appears, \textit{"Your registration was successful"} you are a valid registered user and you can log in using your chosen username and password combination on the login page. \\
		
		\\If the message appears, \textit{"Registration failed"} you have not been successfully registered and may need to check your connection with the server, and your configuration settings.  If your device is not properly configured to use an available online Jabber server, you will not be able to register.\\
		
		\\Also ensure that all the input text fields are correctly completed, and that both the password fields match before you click on the Register button.  If you decide that you no longer wish to register to the TeXchat application, you can simply click on the Cancel button at the bottom left of the registration form.\\
